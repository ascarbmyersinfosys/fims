# Media Device Control Framework - Schemas

These are an updated version of the MDCF schema developed as part of 
the liason between the FIMS technical board and MDCF ad-hoc group in 
the SMPTE. These files are included here temporarily while processes
within the SMPTE address their open publication at a URL that matches 
the namespace URI.

Once these schema have passed SMPTE FCD ballot and are published at 
the smpte-ra website, they will be removed from this package and 
"schemaLocation" references updated to point at the externally published
versions.
