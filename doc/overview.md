# Specification of the FIMS Media SOA Framework
### General Description - Version 1.3

_Previous_: [Reference documents](./referenceDocuments.md) | _Up_: [Contents](./introduction.md) | _Next_: [High-level architectures](./high-levelArchitectures.md)

## Overview

This section is informative.

This specification defines a common approach to the integration of software components in modern media 
production facilities, which is believed to be a fundamental need of the entire media industry.

The specification is based on an overall framework for integration of reusable components for multimedia 
content production, which would support the business functions of the professional media industry. This framework 
for media services includes specific detailed definitions of common media service interfaces.

The focus of this specification is on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and reflects a move by the media industry 
toward systems that use this approach. Media companies are moving towards more rapid adoption of these systems because 
of a need to increase agility in a market where user requirements are changing rapidly. In addition to the need for 
agility, these companies require the increased maintainability, scalability and extensibility that standardized 
service interfaces provide.

To properly exploit this technology a common framework should be adopted to help ensure integration interoperability, 
interchangeability and reusability of services. This will drastically reduce integration costs, allow users to more 
freely choose the most appropriate products on the market at any given time, improve maintainability, and aid in the 
adoption of new technologies.

The [high-level architectures section](./high-levelArchitectures.md) gives an overview of the high-level architecture, 
and provides the overall reference model of the FIMS Framework.

[Media service management](./mediaServiceManagement.md) is described, with specification of service lifecycle and the 
lifecycle of a job.

[Media service awareness](./mediaServiceAwareness.md) description includes the service registry and service description.

The final section describes [media service behaviour](./mediaServiceBehaviour.md), including:

* service behaviour that is common to all categories of services;
* bebaviour specific to each service category.

Details of the data model and communtaiton protocol of FIMS are specified and described in the [self-documenting technical 
schemas and reltaed artefacts](../WSDL-REST-XSD). 

Future versions of the FIMS specification will continue to expand the number of supported media service interfaces.
