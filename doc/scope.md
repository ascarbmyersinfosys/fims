## Scope

This documentation describes a vendor-neutral common framework for implementing Interoperable Media Services using a 
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based system for use in broadcast, production, post production, media distribution, 
and media archive applications. The framework supports interoperability, interchangeability and reusability of media 
specific services.

The high-level architecture and framework is described. This framework covers the following system and management 
requirements: service management, awareness, behaviour and communication, content and time awareness.

This documentation should be read in conjunction with the following:

* [FIMS schema files comprising WSDL and XSD definitions](../WSDL-REST-XSD/)
* FIMS API documentation __LINK REQUIRED__

The standard major, minor and revision numerical versioning system is used for release management of the specification. 
1.3.x releases of the specification shall contain minor revisions addressing inconsistencies and defects within the basic 
1.3 release. Additional features to the 1.3 release will only be added to a future 1.x document.
